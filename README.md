In this project I was testing the hypothesis, that a change in hiring practices of russian courts changed verdicts. I have collected a large database of courts decisions from 2008 to 2022 including their texts (>150gb). 

This project was made as a substitution of a final exam on Development Econ course. 

Now this project is abandoned, since my main focus is macro, so write to me if you are interested to in using the data.
